Chapter 1

Summary:

Computer-systems performance analysis often feels more like an art than a science.
    Indeed, different individuals can sometimes reach apparently contradictory conclusions when analyzing the same system or set of systems.
    While this  type of ambiguity can be quite frustrating, it is often due to misunderstandings of  what was actually being measured, or disagreements about how the data should  be analyzed or interpreted.
    These differences further emphasize the need to  clearly communicate all results and to completely specify the tools, techniques,  and system parameters used to collect and understand the data.
    As you study the following chapters, my hope is that you will begin to develop an appreciation for this art of measurement, interpretation, and communication in addition to developing a deeper understanding of its mathematical and scientific underpinnings.

1. Respond to the question quoted at the beginning of this chapter, 'Performance can be bad, but can it ever be wrong?'


2. Performance analysis should be thought of as a decision-making process. Section 1.2 lists several common goals of a performance-analysis experiment. List other possible goals of the performance-analysis decision-making process. Who are the beneficiaries of each of these possible goals?


3. Table 1.1 compares the three main performance-analysis solution techniques across several criteria. What additional criteria could be used to compare these techniques?


4. Identify the most appropriate solution technique for each of the following situations.
    (a) Estimating the performance beneÂ®t of a new feature that an engineer is  considering adding to a computer system currently being designed.
    (b) Determining when it is time for a large insurance company to upgrade to  a new system.
    (c) Deciding the best vendor from which to purchase new computers for an  expansion to an academic computer lab.
    (d) Determining the minimum performance necessary for a computer system  to be used on a deep-space probe with very limited available electrical  power.
